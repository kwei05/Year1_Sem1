## Reflection
The Programming Technique I course was an incredible introduction to the fundamentals of programming, with C++ as the primary language. It provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving skills, which are essential for my journey in computer science. Learning key concepts like preprocessor directives, data types, and control structures felt like building a solid base for constructing efficient and structured code.

As the course progressed, I gained hands-on experience with functions, arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types. These concepts served as a versatile toolkit, enabling me to tackle a wide variety of programming challenges. Beyond solving problems, these tools taught me to approach tasks methodically, emphasizing efficiency and elegance in my solutions.

Reflecting on the course, I see how these concepts interconnect, shaping my understanding of programming and problem-solving. The logical thinking and skills I developed here have not only boosted my confidence but also sparked a deeper interest in exploring advanced programming topics in the future.

This course marks the beginning of an exciting journey in the world of coding, and I am eager to continue building on this foundation.
