# Design Thinking Project
### Reflection
Working on the Smart Retractable Canopy project as part of the Technology and Information System course has been a transformative experience. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical problem, enhancing my understanding of IoT and Artificial Intelligence applications. Collaborating with my team, we tackled the common challenges faced by car porch users in Malaysia, such as getting wet in the rain or enduring intense heat under traditional canopies.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in prototype development, integrating sensors, and considering user needs. The process of designing and creating the canopy helped me think from the userâ€™s perspective, ensuring the final product was intuitive and efficient. Additionally, I learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and iterative improvement during each phase of the project.

This experience has inspired me to explore further innovations that bridge technology and everyday life. It has reinforced my goal of creating solutions that improve user interaction with technology while addressing real-world challenges.
