# PC Assemble (Lab)
On Wednesday, November 6, 2024, a PC assembly activity took place in the laboratory on Level 3 of the N28 building. Students collaborated in groups of six, under the supervision of technicians who demonstrated the process of dismantling a PC. Following this, each group was assigned the task of reassembling the computer independently.

## Reflection
The PC assembly activity was a hands-on and educational experience that offered valuable insights into the inner workings of a computer. Collaborating in groups of six, the activity not only deepened my understanding of computer hardware but also enhanced my problem-solving and teamwork skills.

The process began with guidance from technicians, who carefully explained the steps involved in disassembling a PC. This initial phase was crucial in building a clear understanding of how various components like the motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply, and storage devices connect and function together. It was fascinating to see how each part plays a specific role in ensuring the system operates efficiently.

Reassembling the PC as a group presented a unique challenge that required focus, communication, and coordination. While we encountered some difficulties, such as aligning connectors or understanding cable management, working through these issues helped us develop patience and critical thinking. The satisfaction of successfully reassembling the PC was incredibly rewarding and reinforced the importance of hands-on learning.

This activity also highlighted the importance of paying attention to detail, as even minor mistakes could affect the system's performance. It underscored how vital practical knowledge is in addition to theoretical learning, especially in fields like IT and engineering.

Overall, this experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also improved my ability to collaborate effectively in a team. It has motivated me to further explore hardware assembly and maintenance, as well as appreciate the complexity and precision involved in building a functional computer system.
